# Classis Botrealis

> Functionality is very limited when deployed by itself - it integrates with an [event gateway](https://github.com/trinitrotoluene/vela) to manage the bitcraft connection.

Welcome to the Classis Botrealis codebase. This bot is mainly a collection of experimental features hacked on top of the Bitcraft SpacetimeDB backend.

While you're welcome to self-host the project, I'm mainly making this code available as a reference for others to help demystify working with Bitcraft's backend. If you'd like to use the bot, please just invite it to your server!

## Features

> [!NOTE]  
> Due to player token limitations most bot features currently only "see" regions 9 and 6.

## Contributions

In general I welcome contributions. However, please reach out BEFORE spending time building a feature so we can discuss it!

I do also expect features to meet certain minimum standards of unit/integration test coverage before they can be included.

Please refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the CLA.

## Acknowledgements

Huge shoutout to [Wiz](https://github.com/wizjany) and the other good folks over in the BitMiners server. I'm standing on the shoulders of their hard work and this would have been so much more tedious to build without them.
